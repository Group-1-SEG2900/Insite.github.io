Deliverable 1:
Product / Service Name: Insite
Brief Description: A social app that directly connects people who are at the same event through photo and video sharing. 
Users can share their experience/perspective at specific events (concerts, sports games, conferences, etc.) and have an 
insight into people from the same crowd in real-time (or after). Events are split into categories ("folders") for users 
to find content and other attendees in one place. (Content is also public for non-event goers unless the
folder is made private by the event holder/company).

Deliverable 2:
#1 - Web Page Design Artifacts:
        The Team has checked in photos, scans of web page design concepts.
        All of these files should be checked into a folder called “mockups”.
        Please only check in easily accessible files such as (.jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .pdf, .txt). If you are using programs like Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch - please export to .jpg or .png before submitting.
#2 - Web Page Implementation
        The team has checked in all HTML pages to GitHub
            Home Page
            Product Features Page
            Pricing Page
            Team Page
        1pt for each of the above pages. 1pt for team participation (each member has checked in something).
